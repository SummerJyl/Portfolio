## Note: Vite Project Image Caching and Build Issues

**Issue:**
After updating image assets (e.g., screenshots) in a Vite project, the old images still appear in the deployed or previewed site, causing broken or outdated visuals.

**Root Causes:**

* Old images remain in the `/public/screenshots` folder and get copied to `/dist/screenshots` during build.
* Vite expects the main `index.html` file at the project root (not inside `/public`). If misplaced, build fails.
* The `base` option in `vite.config.js/ts` may not match the subpath where the site is served, causing incorrect asset URLs.
* Browser or server caching may cause stale images to persist.

**Fix Steps:**

1. **Ensure project structure is correct:**

   * `index.html` must be in the project root (same folder as `package.json` and `vite.config.js/ts`).
   * Static assets (images, fonts, etc.) go inside `/public` folder at the root.
2. **Clean old or unused images:**

   * Delete outdated or duplicate images from `/public/screenshots`.
   * Example:

     ```bash
     rm /path/to/project/public/screenshots/old-image.png
     ```
3. **Update image references in code:**

   * Use absolute paths relative to the root, e.g.,

     ```jsx
     <img src="/screenshots/new-image.png" alt="Description" />
     ```
4. **Set correct base path in `vite.config.js/ts`:**

   * For dev server: `base: '/'`
   * For production build (if served on subpath): `base: '/Portfolio/'` (replace with your actual subpath)
5. **Rebuild the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. **Preview and verify:**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   * Confirm images load correctly and URLs are accurate.
7. **Deploy updated `dist` folder.**

This process ensures your Vite build includes only the correct, updated images and resolves broken image links caused by outdated assets or incorrect paths.
