        Hi, I’m Jylian Summers — Senior Full Stack Engineer with 10 years strong UX sensibilities - I don't just build features, intuitive user experiences backed by clean, maintainable code. 
        I also build scalable, high-performance web applications using React, Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. 
        AWS certified with expertise in cloud architecture, serverless applications, and distributed systems. 
        I specialize in architecting APIs, optimizing databases, and delivering mission-critical applications for healthcare and complex domains. 
        My work spans real-time data processing pipelines, microservices architecture, and AI-integrated workflows. 
        As a technical leader, I mentor teams, drive architectural decisions, and balance rapid iteration with long-term scalability. 
        I thrive in ambiguous, fast-paced environments where engineering shapes product strategy.
